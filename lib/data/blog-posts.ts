When business owners ask me about website costs, the honest answer is: it depends. But that's not helpful, so let me break down what you can actually expect to pay in 2026.

## The Quick Answer

- **DIY Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace): £100-300/year
- **Template WordPress Site**: £500-1,500 one-time + £100-200/year hosting
- **Custom Website (Freelancer)**: £1,500-5,000 one-time
- **Agency Website**: £5,000-20,000+ one-time

## What Affects the Price?

### Number of Pages
A 5-page brochure site costs less than a 20-page site with multiple service pages, location pages, and blog functionality.

### Custom Design vs Templates
Templates are cheaper upfront but limit your brand. Custom design costs more but creates something unique that converts better.

### Functionality
Simple contact forms are included in most projects. E-commerce, booking systems, member areas, and custom integrations add to the cost.

### Content & SEO
Do you have content ready? Professional copywriting and SEO setup add to the investment but significantly improve results.

## What I Recommend for Small Businesses

For most small businesses in South London and Kent, a custom website in the £1,500-3,500 range delivers the best ROI. You get:

- Professional, unique design that builds trust
- Mobile-optimised performance
- Basic SEO setup to help you rank locally
- Content management so you can make updates

Below this price point, you're typically compromising on quality or getting template-based solutions. Above this, you're paying for additional functionality or agency overheads.

## The Hidden Costs to Watch

- **Hosting**: £50-200/year for quality hosting
- **Domain**: £10-20/year
- **SSL Certificate**: Usually included with good hosting
- **Updates & Maintenance**: DIY or £50-150/month for managed
- **Premium Plugins/Themes**: Can add £100-500

## Making the Decision

Consider your website as an investment in lead generation. A £3,000 website that brings in one extra client per month at £500 average value pays for itself in 6 months.

The question isn't "how little can I spend?" but "what investment will generate the best return?"

    description:
      "A detailed breakdown of iOS app development costs. Learn the difference between MVP and full product pricing, and what factors affect your quote.",
    date: "2025-12-28",

    category: "iOS Development",
    content: `
Building an iOS app is a significant investment. Unlike websites, there are no good "cheap" options — you're either building something custom or you're not building an app. Here's what to expect.

## Cost Ranges for iOS Apps

- **Simple MVP App**: £5,000-10,000
- **Full-Featured App**: £12,000-25,000
- **Complex/Enterprise App**: £30,000-100,000+

These are UK freelancer/small studio prices. Large agencies typically charge 2-3x more.

## MVP vs Full Product: What's the Difference?

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — £5,000-10,000
An MVP includes only the core features needed to test your concept. Think of it as a functional prototype.

**What you get:**
- Core feature set (usually 3-5 key features)
- Basic but clean UI design
- Standard user authentication
- App Store submission
- Push notifications
- Basic analytics

**What you don't get:**
- Advanced features
- Custom animations
- Multiple user roles
- Complex integrations
- Admin dashboard

### Full Product — £12,000-25,000
A complete, polished app ready for serious business use.

**What you get:**
- Full feature set
- Custom, polished UI/UX design
- Advanced authentication
- Payment integration
- Admin dashboard/backend
- Multiple user types
- In-depth analytics
- Extensive testing

## What Factors Affect App Cost?

### Design Complexity
Simple, clean designs cost less than elaborate custom interfaces with animations and complex interactions.

### Backend Requirements
Does your app need a server? Custom API? Real-time features? Integration with existing systems? Each adds cost.

### Third-Party Integrations
Payment processing, maps, social login, push notifications — each integration takes time to implement properly.

### User Types
A single user type is straightforward. Multiple roles (admin, staff, customer) multiply complexity.

### App Store Features
In-app purchases, subscriptions, and Apple Pay integration require additional development and testing.

## Timeline Expectations

- **MVP**: 8-12 weeks
- **Full Product**: 12-20 weeks
- **Complex App**: 20-40+ weeks

These timelines include design, development, testing, and App Store submission.

## Android Too?

Cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter) can reduce costs for building both iOS and Android. However, if your primary audience uses iPhone (common among UK consumers), starting with native iOS often makes more sense.

## Making the Decision

Start with an MVP if:
- You're testing a new concept
- Budget is limited
- You want to validate before investing heavily
- You need something live quickly

Go for full product if:
- You know exactly what you need
- It's core to your business
- You have the budget
- You need advanced features from day one

I get asked this question a lot: "Do I need a full website, or can I just build a landing page?" The answer depends on your business model and goals.

## The Quick Answer

- **Landing pages** are better for specific campaigns with a single goal
- **Websites** are better for businesses that need to build trust and explain multiple services
- Most businesses need **both** — a website as their home base, with landing pages for campaigns

## What's the Difference?

### Landing Page
A single page designed for one specific action. No navigation, no distractions, just a focused message driving toward one conversion goal (sign up, book, buy).

**Best for:**
- Paid advertising campaigns
- Product launches
- Event registrations
- Lead magnets
- Testing new offers

### Website
A multi-page site that explains your business comprehensively. Navigation allows visitors to explore services, learn about you, read case studies, and find contact information.

**Best for:**
- Building long-term brand presence
- SEO and organic search
- Complex services that need explanation
- Businesses that rely on trust
- Companies with multiple offerings

## When Landing Pages Win

Landing pages typically convert 2-3x higher than website pages for specific campaigns. Why?

1. **No distractions** — Visitors can't wander off to other pages
2. **Single focus** — One message, one action
3. **Message match** — Copy can match exactly what the ad promised
4. **Speed** — Often faster and simpler to build

If you're running paid ads (Google, Facebook), landing pages almost always outperform sending traffic to your homepage.

## When Websites Win

Websites perform better when:

1. **Trust matters** — Visitors need to research you before committing
2. **SEO is important** — Multiple pages rank for different searches
3. **Services are complex** — People need information before contacting
4. **Longer sales cycle** — Visitors return multiple times before converting

For most service businesses (plumbers, lawyers, consultants, agencies), a proper website builds the credibility needed to win work.

## The Ideal Setup

For most small businesses, the best approach is:

1. **Core website** — Professional site explaining who you are, what you do, and why you're the right choice
2. **Service-specific landing pages** — For paid campaigns targeting specific services
3. **Location pages** — For local SEO targeting specific areas

This gives you the best of both worlds: organic search visibility and trust-building from the website, plus high-converting pages for campaigns.

## What to Focus on First

If you're starting from zero:

1. Build a solid 5-10 page website first
2. Once that's driving organic traffic, add landing pages for paid campaigns
3. Test and optimise your landing pages based on data

Don't skip the website and go straight to landing pages — you'll miss out on long-term organic growth.

      "Practical AI automations that any small business can implement. Real examples that save time without requiring technical expertise.",

    category: "AI & Automation",
    content: `
AI isn't just for big tech companies. Small businesses are using practical AI automations to save 10, 15, even 20+ hours every week. Here are 10 automations that actually work.

## 1. Customer Support Chatbot
**Time saved: 5-15 hours/week**

A well-trained chatbot handles common questions 24/7: business hours, pricing enquiries, service availability, booking queries. Your actual customers get instant answers while you focus on complex issues.

**Works well for:** Any business with repetitive customer questions

## 2. Lead Qualification & Routing
**Time saved: 3-8 hours/week**

Instead of manually reviewing every enquiry, AI scores leads based on their responses and routes hot prospects immediately to your inbox (or phone) while auto-responding to low-priority enquiries.

**Works well for:** Professional services, agencies, high-value B2B

## 3. Appointment Booking Assistant
**Time saved: 2-5 hours/week**

AI handles the back-and-forth of scheduling: checking availability, suggesting times, sending confirmations, and reminding customers before appointments.

**Works well for:** Consultants, salons, clinics, any appointment-based business

## 4. Email Triage & Response
**Time saved: 3-6 hours/week**

AI categorises incoming emails, drafts responses to common queries, and flags urgent messages. You review and send rather than starting from scratch.

**Works well for:** Anyone drowning in email

## 5. Invoice Processing
**Time saved: 2-4 hours/week**

AI extracts data from invoices and receipts, categorises expenses, and enters them into your accounting software. No more manual data entry.

**Works well for:** Any business processing multiple invoices

## 6. Social Media Content Scheduling
**Time saved: 2-4 hours/week**

AI generates post ideas, adapts content for different platforms, and suggests optimal posting times based on your audience engagement patterns.

**Works well for:** Businesses that need consistent social presence

## 7. Meeting Notes & Follow-ups
**Time saved: 1-3 hours/week**

AI transcribes meetings, extracts action items, and drafts follow-up emails. You review rather than write from scratch.

**Works well for:** Anyone with regular client or team meetings

## 8. Review Response
**Time saved: 1-2 hours/week**

AI drafts personalised responses to Google/Trustpilot/Yelp reviews — both positive and negative — for your approval before posting.

**Works well for:** Businesses dependent on reviews

## 9. Report Generation
**Time saved: 2-4 hours/week**

AI compiles data from multiple sources into formatted reports — sales summaries, marketing performance, project updates — automatically.

**Works well for:** Anyone producing regular reports

## 10. Document Summarisation
**Time saved: 1-3 hours/week**

AI summarises long documents, contracts, proposals, and research papers, extracting key points and potential issues.

**Works well for:** Professional services, any document-heavy business

## Getting Started

You don't need to implement all 10. Start with one that addresses your biggest time drain:

1. **Identify your bottleneck** — What repetitive task takes the most time?
2. **Start simple** — Pick one automation with clear ROI
3. **Measure the impact** — Track time saved
4. **Expand gradually** — Add more automations as you see results

The best automation is the one that actually gets used. Don't over-complicate it.

    slug: "what-to-prepare-before-hiring-web-designer",
    title: "What to Prepare Before Hiring a Web Designer",
    description:
      "Make your web project run smoother by preparing these essentials before kickoff. A checklist that saves time and money.",
    date: "2025-12-08",
    readingTime: "7 min read",
    category: "Web Design",
    content: `
The best web projects start with good preparation. Here's what to have ready before your first meeting with a web designer — and what you don't need to worry about yet.

## Essential: Must Have Ready

### 1. Clear Business Goals
What do you want the website to achieve? Be specific:
- "Get more phone enquiries from local customers"
- "Sell products online with home delivery"
- "Establish credibility with potential enterprise clients"

Vague goals like "look professional" don't help. Specific outcomes guide every design decision.

### 2. Examples of Sites You Like
Find 3-5 websites you admire. They don't need to be competitors — any site that captures something you want. Note what specifically you like about each:
- "Clean, minimal layout"
- "The way they explain their process"
- "That contact form is simple"

### 3. Target Audience Understanding
Who are your customers? What do they care about? What problems are they trying to solve when they find you? The more you understand your audience, the better the site will serve them.

### 4. Competitor Awareness
Who are your main competitors online? What do they do well? What could be better? This helps position your site effectively.

### 5. Budget Range
Even a rough range helps. There's a massive difference between a £1,500 project and a £10,000 project — knowing your budget helps designers recommend appropriate solutions.

### 6. Timeline Requirements
Do you have a deadline? A launch date? An event the site needs to be ready for? Be realistic — rushing projects rarely ends well.

## Important: Should Have Ready

### 7. Brand Assets
If you have them:
- Logo files (vector/SVG preferred)
- Brand colours (hex codes if you have them)
- Fonts you use
- Existing brand guidelines

Don't have them? Not a problem — many designers can help establish these.

### 8. Content Outline
You don't need finished copy, but knowing what pages you need and roughly what each should cover is helpful:
- Homepage: about us, services overview, testimonials
- Services: three main services, pricing info
- About: story, team, process
- Contact: form, phone, location

### 9. Photography & Images
High-quality photos of your work, team, or premises make a huge difference. Stock photos can fill gaps, but real images build more trust.

### 10. Technical Requirements
Any specific needs?
- Booking system integration
- E-commerce functionality  
- Member login area
- Third-party tools to integrate

## Don't Worry About Yet

### Detailed Copy
Final website copy usually comes after design. Focus on what you want to say, not the exact words yet.

### Every Page Planned
You don't need to map every single page. Start with the core pages; the structure often evolves during design.

### Technical Specifications
Unless you have strong preferences, let your designer recommend the technical approach.

### Perfect Photos
Good photos help, but a skilled designer can work with what you have or recommend stock alternatives.

## The Kickoff Conversation

With these essentials ready, your first conversation with a designer will be productive rather than exploratory. You'll get:
- More accurate quotes
- Realistic timelines
- Better design proposals
- Fewer surprises mid-project

Time spent preparing upfront saves time (and money) throughout the project.

    title: "Local SEO Basics for Service Businesses in South London & Kent",
    description:
      "A practical guide to local SEO for service businesses. How to appear when customers search for services in your area.",

    readingTime: "10 min read",
    category: "SEO",

When someone searches "plumber Streatham" or "accountant Tunbridge Wells", you want your business to appear. That's local SEO — and it's essential for service businesses in South London and Kent.

## Why Local SEO Matters

- 46% of all Google searches have local intent
- 78% of local mobile searches result in offline purchase
- Local results show before regular results

For service businesses, local SEO is often the highest-ROI marketing activity. People searching "near me" or "[service] [location]" are ready to buy.

## The Three Pillars of Local SEO

### 1. Google Business Profile (Essential)

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is the foundation of local SEO. It's what shows up in the map pack — those top 3 listings with the map.

**Set up properly:**
- Claim and verify your listing
- Choose the right categories (be specific)
- Add complete, accurate information
- Upload quality photos (exterior, interior, team, work)
- Set service areas correctly

**Keep it active:**
- Post updates weekly
- Respond to all reviews (good and bad)
- Add new photos regularly
- Keep hours and info current
- Answer questions

**Get reviews:**
- Ask happy customers to leave reviews
- Make it easy with a direct link
- Respond to every review professionally
- Aim for consistency over spikes

### 2. On-Page SEO (Your Website)

Your website needs to tell Google where you operate and what you do.

**Location pages:**
Create pages for each area you serve:
- /south-london/streatham/
- /kent/tunbridge-wells/

Each page should have unique content about serving that area — not just swapping place names.

**NAP consistency:**
Name, Address, Phone number must be identical everywhere — website, Google Business, directories, social media.

**Title tags and meta descriptions:**
Include location in titles: "Emergency Plumber in Streatham | 24/7 Service | Your Company"

**Schema markup:**
Add LocalBusiness structured data to help Google understand your business information.

**Mobile-first:**
Google uses mobile version for ranking. Make sure your site works perfectly on phones.

### 3. Off-Page SEO (Citations & Links)

**Citations:**
Get listed in relevant directories with consistent NAP:
- Yell.com
- Thomson Local
- Yelp UK
- Industry-specific directories
- Local business directories

**Local links:**
Links from local sources carry extra weight:
- Local news sites
- Community organisations
- Local business partnerships
- Chamber of commerce
- Sponsorships

## Quick Wins for South London & Kent Businesses

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Claim/verify Google Business Profile
2. Complete all GBP information
3. Add 10+ quality photos
4. Ensure NAP consistency on website

### Week 2: Reviews
1. Identify 10 happy customers
2. Create a direct review link
3. Send personalised review requests
4. Set up review monitoring

### Week 3: On-Site
1. Create/optimise location pages
2. Add LocalBusiness schema
3. Optimise title tags with locations
4. Check mobile performance

### Week 4: Citations
1. List on major directories
2. Find industry-specific directories
3. Ensure NAP consistency everywhere
4. Set up citation monitoring

## Measuring Results

Track these metrics:
- Google Business Profile views
- Direction requests
- Phone calls from GBP
- Website visits from local searches
- Keyword rankings for "[service] [location]"

Give it time — local SEO typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results, but it compounds over time.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Inconsistent NAP** — One wrong phone number can hurt rankings
2. **Ignoring reviews** — Unresponded reviews look bad
3. **Keyword stuffing** — "Best plumber Streatham plumber cheap plumber" doesn't work
4. **Duplicate content** — Location pages must be genuinely unique
5. **Neglecting mobile** — Most local searches are mobile

## Getting Help

Local SEO is ongoing work. If you don't have time to manage it yourself, consider:
- Monthly SEO retainer (we offer these)
- One-time setup with training
- Quarterly audits and adjustments

The most important thing is consistency. A little ongoing effort beats occasional intensive work.
